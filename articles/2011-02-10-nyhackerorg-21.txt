Hey Hackers,

Arbitrary version numbers aside, today we are launching two brand new portions of nyhacker.org - a [blog](http://blog.nyhacker.org/) and a [wiki](http://wiki.nyhacker.org/). These new resources will help us better communicate among ourselves and to the outside world.

We hope to use the [blog](http://blog.nyhacker.org/) to talk about our events, highlight some awesome projects from the community, and let people know about interesting opportunities and resources for ny hackers.

As for the [wiki](http://wiki.nyhacker.org/), please make appropriate contributions as often as you like and about whatever hacker topics you like! Collaborate, explain, annotate, wikify.

Tech details: Both the blog and wiki are git-powered. The blog uses toto and the wiki uses gollum. Having git-based tools seemed hacker-appropriate and fit well into our current architecture.

Hope you enjoy, please feel free to send any feedback or comments to [hacker@lists.nyhacker.org](mailto:hacker@lists.nyhacker.org)
