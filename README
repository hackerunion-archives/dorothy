PLEASE UPDATE THIS FILE IS SOMETHING IS MISSING OR INCORRECT

Recommended workflow:

1. Clone the blog repo:
-----------------------

$ cd ~
$ git clone /var/apps/blog blog


2. Author a new article:
------------------------

$ rake new
(in /home/achin/blog)
Title: My New Post!   

  toto ~ an article was created for you at articles/2011-02-08-my-new-post.txt.


Edit the new article template.  A regular git-like workflow applies here.  For
example:
 * git diff to see what you've written.
 * git commit to commit your new article.  Note it's not published yet.
 * Ask friend to git pull into a new branch to proof-read.
 * Friend fixes a few typos and commits the change.
 * You pull changes back in to your repo and review.

2.5 Edit an existing article:
-----------------------------

If you just want to edit an existing article, you can do that as well.  Simply
edit the file in question and commit your changes.

3. Previewing (optional)
------------------------

If you want to preview your changes in a browser (for example, to make sure you
got the formatting correct), you can start up a local server with any Rack compliant
web server.  Some examples:

$ thin start -R config.ru

or:

$ unicorn

Note: there is currently a problem where local servers don't have the correct URLs for links
and stylesheets.  We'll fix that.


4. Publish repo:
---------------

Push to publish: a two-step process

Step 1:
$ git push origin master

Step 2:
In /var/apps/wiki, update the working copy with:
$ git reset HEAD (I think this is the right command)

Another possible workflow is to simply commit your changes locally (in ~/blog) and
pull from /var/apps/blog:

~/blog$ git commit -m "..."
~/blog$ cd /var/apps/blog
/var/apps/blog$ git pull /home/achin/blog


5. Misc:
--------

* Avoid working directly in /var/apps/blog.  Doing so will make your 
  works-in-progress visible to the world
* Avoid creating the files in articles/ by hand.  Use "rake new" if possible. 
* Currently only wheel has the ability to modify the /var/apps/blog wiki.  If a 
  non-root hacker wants to author a blog post, then can:
  1. clone the repo
  2. author an article
  3. commit it
  4. ask a member of root to review and publish
