PLEASE UPDATE THIS FILE IS SOMETHING IS MISSING OR INCORRECT

Recommended workflow:

1. Clone the blog repo:
-----------------------

$ cd ~
$ git clone git@github.com:nyhacker/dorothy.git blog


2. Author a new article:
------------------------

$ rake new
(in /home/achin/blog)
Title: My New Post!   

  toto ~ an article was created for you at articles/2011-02-08-my-new-post.txt.


Edit the new article template.  A regular git-like workflow applies here.  For
example:
 * git diff to see what you've written.
 * git commit to commit your new article.  Note it's not published yet.
 * Ask friend to git pull into a new branch to proof-read.
 * Friend fixes a few typos and commits the change.
 * You pull changes back in to your repo and review.

2.5 Edit an existing article:
-----------------------------

If you just want to edit an existing article, you can do that as well.  Simply
edit the file in question and commit your changes.

3. Previewing (optional)
------------------------

If you want to preview your changes in a browser (for example, to make sure you
got the formatting correct), you can start up a local server with any Rack compliant
web server.  Some examples:

$ thin start -R config.ru

or:

$ unicorn


4. Push changes:
---------------

This pushes the changes to our github fork:

$ git push origin master

(or if you have another remote, replace 'origin' with your remote name)

5. Publish:
-----------

In /var/apps/blog, pull in the latest version from github:
$ $ git pull github master


5. Misc:
--------

* Avoid working directly in /var/apps/blog.  Doing so will make your 
  works-in-progress visible to the world
* Avoid creating the files in articles/ by hand.  Use "rake new" if possible. 
* Currently only wheel has the ability to modify the /var/apps/blog dir.  If a 
  non-root hacker wants to author a blog post, then can:
  1. clone the repo
  2. author an article
  3. commit it
  4. ask a member of root to review and publish
